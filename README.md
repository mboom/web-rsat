Web bases RSAT tools

The goal of this project is to make a web-based version of Remote Server Administration Tools that can be executed on a Linux or Windows platform and opened in any major webbrowser. The idea is to create a RSAT-like package with some kind of platform independency that can be used to manage Microsoft AD or Samba services.
